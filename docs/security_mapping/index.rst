SIMP Security Control Mapping
================================

This is the security control mapping for SIMP.  The document has two main 
sections.  The first contains security control sources 
which are references or reference documents that contain security guidance.
The second section contains the security components.  In our case, a 
component is a SIMP module.  Each component is documented and mapped to the
security control sources.
