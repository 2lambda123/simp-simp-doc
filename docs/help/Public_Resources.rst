Public Resources
================

Many resources are available for getting help with SIMP. For FOSS support, as
the community can handle it, you are welcome to use one of the following
resources.

Live Chat
---------

* `SIMP Project Chat`_

  * The SIMP Project wants to ensure that active communication is available to
    all SIMP users. Please join us to discuss SIMP use and development.

Mailing Lists
-------------

* `SIMP Users Mailing List`_

  * General user discussion

* `SIMP Announcement List`_

  * Announcements about changes to the SIMP environment

* `SIMP Security List`_ (security@simp-project.com)

  * A post-only alias for alerting the SIMP team to security issues

Bug Tracking
------------

If you find a bug, we'd like to encourage you to file a bug in the associated project in the `SIMP GitHub`_ space.

If you do not know what project to choose, just drop it in `simp-core`_ and we'll figure it out!

If you do not use GitHub, feel free to email your issues or use Slack via the links in the previous
section.
