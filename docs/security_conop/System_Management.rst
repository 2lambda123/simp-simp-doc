This chapter contains SIMP security concepts that are related to the
management security controls in `NIST

Risk Assessment
---------------

This section describes the process of identifying risks within a system.

SIMP Self Risk Assessment
-------------------------

Risk can be found in any system. The SIMP team is constantly evaluating
the system and the settings to minimize inherit risk. Most risks can be
mitigated by processes and procedures at the implementation level. The
following table describes the known areas in SIMP. [RA-1]

Vulnerability Scanning
----------------------

The SIMP development and security team performs regular vulnerability
scanning of the product using commercial and open source tools. Results
and mitigations for findings from those tools can be provided upon
request. [CA-2, RA-5]

Security Assessment and Authorization
-------------------------------------

Assessment and authorization varies by implementation. Implementations
are encouraged to use documentation artifacts provided by the SIMP team
to assist with assessment and authorization. [CA-2]
