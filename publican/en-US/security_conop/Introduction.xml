  <para>
   This manual describes the security concepts of the SIMP system. 
   The system was originally designed to meet a specific set of 
   technical security controls using industry best practices and 
   has been modified recently to meet as many of the security controls
   provided by the National Institute 
   of Standards and Technology's (NIST) special publication 
   <ulink url="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html">800-53</ulink> 
   as possible.

  <para>
   This manual outlines three categories of security:

  <para>
   A brief discussion of how the SIMP system helps achieve categories of controls 
   is provided; additional technical details regarding each control can be found 
   in the SIMP Security Controls Traceability Matrix (SCTM).
  </para>  
  <para> 
   When possible, the security control identifier will be found at the end of 
   a concept to provide the reader with a reference to the specific control that is 
   being discussed. The identifier is written as [AB-X(Y)], where A is the control 
   family, X is the control section, and Y is the control enhancement.
