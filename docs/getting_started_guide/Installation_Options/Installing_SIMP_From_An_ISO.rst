Installing SIMP From An ISO
===========================

The benefits of using a SIMP ISO are:

* Suitable for enclave or offline environments
* It is the easiest way to get started and ensure that all files are present
* Your SIMP load will have a disk partitioning scheme compatible with most
  security guides
* Your system will start in :term:`FIPS` mode
* Your disks can be encrypted

  * Please pay attention to the caveats in the :ref:`ig-disk-encryption`
    section

Obtaining the ISO
-----------------

The SIMP ISO can be downloaded from the `official SIMP ISO Share`_.

Installation
------------

The ISO will install on any system that supports the underlying operating system.

When you first boot the ISO, there will be a menu of options. You can either
modify the installation according to those instructions or simply hit
``<Enter>`` to proceed with the automated installation.

Afterwards, you should proceed with the :ref:`simp-installation-guide`.
