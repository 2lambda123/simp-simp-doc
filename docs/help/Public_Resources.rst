Public Resources
================

Many resources are available for getting help with SIMP. For FOSS support, as
the community can handle it, you are welcome to use one of the following
resources.

Live Chat
---------

* `SIMP Project HipChat`_

  * No account is required for this room. However, if you are going to
    participate regularly, please consider signing up for a HipChat account as
    it will allow you to receive offline messages.

  * If you choose to sign up, we recommend using a modifier to your email
    address such as `yourname+simp@gmail.com` since HipChat binds your account
    to the group that you join.

Mailing Lists
-------------

  * `SIMP Q&A Board`_

    * A Question and Answer board for the general community

  * `SIMP Users Mailing List`_

    * General user discussion

 * `SIMP Developers List`_

   * Discussion about development

 * `SIMP Announcement List`_

   * Announcements about changes to the SIMP environment

 * `SIMP Security List`_ (security@simp-project.com)

   * A post-only alias for alerting the SIMP team to security issues
   * Use GPG Key `214BCB69`_ if you would like to encrypt messages
   * If members of the U.S. Government wish to report a Security issue, please
     send a message to this alias indicating that you wish to file a report
     over official channels and someone will contact you with further
     instructions.

Bug Tracking
------------

If you find a bug, we'd like to encourage you to file a bug in our
`JIRA Bug Tracking`_ system. That said, we're happy to hear about issues in
whatever manner is easiest for you.
