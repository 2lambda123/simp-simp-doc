  <title id="ch-ug-SIMP_Administration-title">SIMP Administration</title>
  <para>
    This chapter provides basic guidance on how to administer a
    SIMP environment.
  </para>
  <warning>
    <para>
      While working with the system, keep in mind that Puppet does not
      work well with capital letters in host names. Therefore, they should
      not be used.
    </para>
  </warning>

  <section id="sect-ug-Admin_Basics-Nightly_Updates">
    <title>Nightly Updates</title>
    <para>
      All SIMP systems are configured, by default, to do a
      YUM update of the entire system on a nightly basis.
    </para>
    <para>
      The configuration pulls updates from all repositories
      that the system is aware of. To change this behavior, refer to
      the <xref linkend= "sect-ug-Exclude_Repos"
                endterm= "sect-ug-Exclude_Repos-title"/>
      FAQ section. This configuration is
      also helpful because it is easier to manage symlinks in YUM
      repositories than it is to manage individual package minutia
      for every single package on every system.
    </para>
    <para>
      The general technique is to put packages that all systems will
      receive into the <emphasis role="italic">Updates</emphasis>
      repository provided with SIMP.

      Any packages that will only go to specific system sets will then be
      placed into adjunct repositories under <emphasis role="italic">/srv/www/yum</emphasis>
      and the user will point specific systems at those repositories using
      the <emphasis role="italic">yumrepo</emphasis> Puppet type. Any common
      packages can be symlinked or hard linked between repositories for
      maximum space utilization.
    </para>
  </section>
  <section id="sect-ug-Admin_Basics-Sudosh">
    <title>Sudosh</title>
    <para>
      By default, a SIMP system uses
      <xref linkend="ug-glossary-sudosh-desc"
            endterm="ug-sudosh-term" /> to enable logging of sudo sessions to
      <emphasis role="italic">Rsyslog</emphasis>.
      To open a sudo session as <emphasis role="italic">root</emphasis> (or
      any other user), type <emphasis role="bold">su -</emphasis> as simp, or
      <emphasis role="bold">sudo sudosh</emphasis> as anyone else, instead of
      <emphasis role="bold">sudo su</emphasis>.
    </para>
    <para>
      The logs are stored in <emphasis role="italic">/var/log/sudosh.log</emphasis>.
      Sessions can be replayed by typing <emphasis role="bold">sudosh-syslog-replay</emphasis>.
    </para>
  </section>
  <section id="sect-ug-Admin_Basics-Accounts">
    <title>User Accounts</title>
    <para>
      By default, users can add local users to a system
      or use LDAP to administer users.
    </para>
    <para>
      It is recommended that LDAP is used for adding all regular users
      so that there is no conflict with multiple system updates and synchronization.
      For more information on managing LDAP users, refer to the
      <xref linkend= "ch-ug-User_Management"
            endterm= "ch-ug-User_Management-title"/>
      chapter.
    </para>
    <para>
      It is also possible that there will be users that are local
      to the system. To have these users follow the normal password expiration
      conventions set on the system, use the native Puppet user and group types.
    </para>
    <para>
      To have a user that does not expire, look at the
      <emphasis role="italic">/etc/puppet/localusers</emphasis> file
      to enable these users across the systems. The comments in the file
      provide instructions on generating entries for the desired systems.
      It is hoped that future versions of Puppet will support the modification
      of password expiration values via the native types and that the
      <emphasis role="italic">localusers</emphasis> file will be retired.

  <section id="sect-ug-Admin_Basics-Certificate_Management">
    <title id="sect-ug-Admin_Basics-Certificate_Management-title">Certificate Management</title>
    <para>
      This section describes the two different types of certificates used in a SIMP system
      and how to manage them. For information on initial certificate setup, refer to the
      <xref linkend="sect-ug-Certificates"
            endterm="sect-ug-Certificates-title"/>
      section of the Client Management chapter.
    </para>
    <section id="sect-ug-Admin_Basics-Certificate_Management-Server_Certificates">
      <title id="sect-ug-Admin_Basics-Certificate_Management-Server_Certificates-title">Server Certificates</title>
      <para>
        Server certificates are the standard PKI certificates assigned either by an official CA or generated
        using the FakeCA utility offered by SIMP. They can be found in the
        <emphasis role="italic">/etc/pki/</emphasis> directory of both the client and server systems. These
        certificates are set to expire annually. To change this, edit the following files with the number of
        days for the desired lifespan of the certificates:
      </para>
      <note>
        <para>
          This assumes that the user has generated Certificates with the FakeCA provided by SIMP. If offical
          certificates are being used, these settings must be changed within the official CA, not on the SIMP
          system.
        </para>

        </itemizedlist>
        In addition, any certificates that have already been created and signed will have a config file
        containing all of its details in <emphasis role="italic">/etc/puppet/Config/FakeCA/output/conf/</emphasis>.
      </para>
      <important>
        <para>
          Editing any entries in the above mentioned config files will not affect the existing certificates. To
          make changes to an existing certificate it must be re-created and signed.
        </para>
      </important>
      <para>
        Below is an example of how to change the expiration time from one year (the default) to five years
        for any newly created certificate.
      </para>
      <example>
        <title>Change Certificate Expiration to Five Years</title>

        for file in $(grep -rl 365 /etc/puppet/Config/FakeCA/)
        do
          sed -i 's/365/1825/' $file

    <section id="sect-ug-Admin_Basics-Certificate_Management-Puppet_Certificates">
      <title id="sect-ug-Admin_Basics-Certificate_Management-Puppet_Certificates-title">Puppet Certificates</title>
      <para>
        Puppet certificates are issued and maintained strictly within Puppet. They are different from the server
        certificates and should be managed with the <emphasis role="bold">puppet cert</emphasis> tool. For the
        complete documentation on the <emphasis role="bold">puppet cert</emphasis> tool, 
        visit the <ulink url="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/man/cert.html">Puppet Labs cert manual</ulink>
        detailing its capabilities. On a SIMP system, these certificates are located in the
        <emphasis role="italic">/var/lib/puppet/ssl/</emphasis> directory and are set to expire every five years.
      </para>

  <section id="sect-ug-Admin_Basics-Applications">
    <title>Applications</title>
    <para>
     This section describes how to add services to the servers. To perform this
     action, it is important to understand how to use IPtables
     and what the <emphasis role="italic">svckill.rb</emphasis> script
     does on the system.
    </para>
    <section id="sect-ug-Admin_Basics-Applications-IPTables">
      <title>IPTables</title>
      <para>
      By default, the SIMP system locks down all incoming connections
      to the server save port 22. Port 22 is allowed from all external sources
      since it is expected that the user will want to be able to SSH into
      the systems from the outside at all times.
      </para>
      <para>
      The default alteration for the IPtables start-up script is such
      that it will "fail safe". This means that if the IPtables
      rules are incorrect, the system will not open up the IPtables
      rule set completely. Instead, the system will deny access to all
      ports except port 22 to allow for recovery via SSH.
      </para>
      <para>
      There are many examples of how to use the IPtables
      module in the source code; the Apache module at
      <emphasis role="italic">/etc/puppet/modules/apache</emphasis> is
      a particularly good example. In addition, look at the definitions
      in the IPtables module to understand their purpose and choose the
      best option. Refer to the
      <ulink url="../../developers_guide/rdoc/classes/iptables.html">
      IPtables page of the Developers Guide</ulink> for a good summary
      and example code (HTML version only).

    <section id="sect-ug-Admin_Basics-Applications-svckill">
      <title>svckill.rb</title>
      <para>
      To ensure that the system does not run more services than
      are required, the <emphasis role="italic">svckill.rb</emphasis>
      script has been implemented to stop any service that is not
      properly defined in the Puppet catalogue.
      </para>
      <para>
      To prevent services from stopping, refer to the instructions in the
      <xref linkend="sect-ug-Services_Dying" endterm="sect-ug-Services_Dying-title"/>
      FAQ section.

    <section id="sect-ug-Integrating_Applications-GUI">
      <title>GUI</title>
      <para>
        SIMP was designed as a minimized system, but it is likely that the user
        will want to have a GUI on some of the systems. Refer to the
        <xref linkend="sect-ug-Infrastructure-Setup"
        endterm="sect-ug-Infrastructure-Setup-title"/>
        section for information on setting up GUIs for the systems.
