Installation Options
====================

Please take a look at the :ref:`faq` documentation prior to installing SIMP.
The most relevant questions for new users will always be at the top of the
list.

If you are installing on a system with an existing operating system you will
want to  install from a SIMP Repository.  Otherwise you will probably want to
install from the ISO, which configures the disks and partitions
to be compatible with most STIGs.

Once you're done setting up your environment, you should proceed to the
:ref:`simp-user-guide` for utilizing SIMP to its full potential.

If issues still remain, please drop us a line on the `SIMP Development Mailing List`_.
