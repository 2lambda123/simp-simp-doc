SIMP is a minimized, security-focused, continually managed
operating system overlay compatible with RHEL and CentOS. Each
system is tailored to the hosted project's needs using Puppet.

Fundamentally, SIMP is a framework that is designed to be secure
from a practical point of view out of the box. As a framework,
SIMP is designed to be flexed to meet the needs of the end user.
If, for some reason, this is not possible, then this should be
reported to the developers as a bug.
