Welcome to the SIMP documentation!
==================================

This is the documentation for the |simp_version| release of SIMP.

SIMP is generally compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (\ :term:`RHEL`) and RHEL-derived distributions.

Microsoft Windows support is available via the commercial `Sicura`_ product.


This guide walks users through the process of installing and managing a :term:`SIMP` system. It also
provides a mapping of security features to security requirements, which can be used to document a
system's security conformance.
